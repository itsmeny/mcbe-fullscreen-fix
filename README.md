![in-game](images/ingame.gif)

**MCBE Fullscreen Fix** is a small utility designed to solve the mouse cursor issue that players encounter in Minecraft Bedrock Edition (MCBE) when playing in fullscreen mode on Windows 10. The issue occurs due to the `Edge Swipe` feature, which interferes with the mouse cursor, leading to unresponsive controls or accidental app switching when moving the mouse near the screen edges.

This tool disables the `Edge Swipe` feature by updating the Windows Registry, allowing for a smoother and uninterrupted gaming experience.
